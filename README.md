# Taskinator


## Purpose

This is a browser based Kanban board with 3 basic task statuses, i.e To do, In progress and Complete. You can create tasks, change the status of the task and delete the tasks you don't want to track. The task data will be saved in the localStorage of the browser and the task data will be automatically loaded when the page loads.

* Access the ```DOM``` using methods like ```addEventListener(), querySelector(), createElement(), setAttribute(), ```and``` getAttribute()```.

* Add interactivity with ```HTML``` by adding browser event listeners such as ```click, submit, ```and``` change```.

* Handle events in JavaScript using ```callback functions```.

* Use the ```event``` object.

* Use the DOM to both ```read content``` from the HTML page and ```create new content``` to add to or edit on the page.

* Identify DOM elements using ```HTML5``` data attributes so that we can interact with them.

* Store task items in an organized list using an ```array of objects```.

* Sync the data with the display in the browser.

* Save data using ```localStorage```, and serialize and de-serialize the data using ```JSON.stringify() ```and``` JSON.parse()```.
